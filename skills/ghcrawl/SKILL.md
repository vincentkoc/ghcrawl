# ghcrawl

Use `ghcrawl` as the machine-facing interface for local GitHub duplicate-cluster analysis.

Never read the ghcrawl SQLite database directly with `sqlite3` or any other database client. If the supported CLI cannot return the needed information, report that CLI problem to the user instead of bypassing the interface.

Do not scrape the TUI. Prefer JSON CLI output.

The skill has two modes:

- Default mode: assume API credentials are absent, unavailable, or irrelevant and stay read-only on existing local data.
- API-enabled mode: only after `ghcrawl doctor --json` proves GitHub and OpenAI auth are configured and healthy.

In default mode, do not treat missing credentials as a problem unless the user explicitly asked for an API-backed operation or a supported read-only CLI command failed and `doctor` shows local setup is broken.

Even in API-enabled mode, never run `sync`, `embed`, `cluster`, or `refresh` unless the user explicitly asks for that work. Those commands can take a long time, consume paid API usage, and trigger rate limiting if used too often.

Current pipeline defaults to keep in mind:

- persistent semantic search and clustering use a `vectorlite` sidecar index
- the default summary model is `gpt-5-mini`
- the default embedding basis is `title_original`, so `refresh` does not summarize unless the user explicitly switches to `title_summary`
- changing summary model or embedding basis with `ghcrawl configure` makes the next refresh rebuild vectors and clusters
- opting into `title_summary` can materially improve clustering quality, but it adds OpenAI cost; on `openclaw/openclaw` it improved non-solo cluster membership by about 50%

Also never run `close-thread` or `close-cluster` unless the user explicitly asks you to mark a local thread or cluster closed.

## When to use this skill

- The user wants related issue/PR clusters for one repo.
- The user wants to refresh local ghcrawl data before analysis.
- The user wants cluster summaries, cluster detail dumps, or nearest neighbors from a local ghcrawl database.

## Command preference

Prefer the installed `ghcrawl` bin.

If `ghcrawl` is not on `PATH`, use:

```bash
npx ghcrawl cli ...
```

Do not start by running `ghcrawl --help` or `<subcommand> --help`. The documented command surface in this skill and [references/protocol.md](references/protocol.md) is the default source of truth. If you are actively maintaining `ghcrawl` itself or syntax is genuinely in doubt, command help is available through `ghcrawl help <command>` and `ghcrawl <command> --help`.

## Core workflow

### 1. Default read-only flow

Do not run `doctor` on skill startup by default.

Start with local read-only commands:

Without explicit user direction to refresh data, prefer these local-only commands:

```bash
ghcrawl threads owner/repo --numbers 12345 --json
ghcrawl clusters owner/repo --min-size 10 --limit 20 --sort recent --json
ghcrawl cluster-detail owner/repo --id 123 --member-limit 20 --body-chars 280 --json
ghcrawl threads owner/repo --numbers 42,43,44 --json
ghcrawl author owner/repo --login lqquan --json
ghcrawl search owner/repo --query "download stalls" --mode hybrid --json
ghcrawl neighbors owner/repo --number 42 --limit 10 --json
ghcrawl configure --json
```

These operate on the existing local SQLite dataset.

Treat that stored dataset as the default source of truth for read-only analysis. Do not probe credentials, inspect env vars, or explain missing auth unless an API-backed task was requested or the supported CLI path is failing.

By default:

- `threads` and `author` hide locally closed issues/PRs
- `clusters` and `cluster-detail` hide locally closed clusters

If the user explicitly wants to inspect those records, add `--include-closed`.

Use `threads --numbers 12345` when you need to find the cluster for one specific issue/PR number. The returned thread record includes `clusterId`. If it is non-null, follow with `cluster-detail --id <clusterId>`.

Use `configure --json` when you need to confirm the currently selected summary model or embedding basis before suggesting an expensive refresh.

Use `threads --numbers ...` when you need a batch of specific issue/PR records. Do not pay the CLI startup cost 10 times for 10 separate single-thread lookups.

Use `author --login ...` when you need one author's open threads and their strongest stored same-author similarity matches in one call.

If the user explicitly asks to mark a local issue/PR or cluster closed, use:

```bash
ghcrawl close-thread owner/repo --number 42 --json
ghcrawl close-cluster owner/repo --id 123 --json
```

If `close-thread` closes the last open item in a cluster, ghcrawl will automatically mark that cluster closed too.

### 2. Check local health only when needed

Run:

```bash
ghcrawl doctor --json
```

If the bin is unavailable, fall back to:

```bash
pnpm --filter ghcrawl cli doctor --json
```

Only do this when:

- the user explicitly wants an API-backed operation such as `refresh`, `sync`, `embed`, or `cluster`
- or a read-only request failed and you need to know whether the local install/config/auth state is broken

Interpret the result like this:

- If GitHub/OpenAI auth is missing or unhealthy, stay in read-only mode.
- If GitHub/OpenAI auth is healthy, API-backed operations are available, but still require explicit user direction.

If `doctor` is unhealthy but the user asked only for read-only inspection, say that API-backed refresh is unavailable and continue with read-only CLI commands when possible.

### 3. If the CLI is unavailable or misbehaving

Use one supported fallback path before giving up:

```bash
pnpm --filter ghcrawl cli ...
```

If a documented `ghcrawl` command still fails, hangs, or returns unusable output through the supported CLI path, stop and report that to the user. Do not inspect tables, schema, or rows with `sqlite3`, `pragma`, or ad hoc SQL.

### 4. Refresh local data only when explicitly requested

Only if the user explicitly asks to refresh or rebuild data, and doctor says auth is healthy, use:

```bash
ghcrawl refresh owner/repo
```

This runs, in fixed order:

1. GitHub sync/reconcile
2. summarize-if-needed
3. embed refresh
4. cluster rebuild

You may skip steps only when the user explicitly wants that or the freshness state makes it unnecessary:

```bash
ghcrawl refresh owner/repo --no-sync
ghcrawl refresh owner/repo --no-cluster
```

Do not decide on your own to run `cluster` just because it is local-only. It is still long-running and should be treated as an explicit user-directed operation.

### 5. List clusters

Use:

```bash
ghcrawl clusters owner/repo --min-size 10 --limit 20 --sort recent --json
```

This returns:

- repo stats
- freshness state
- cluster summaries

### 6. Inspect one cluster

Use:

```bash
ghcrawl cluster-detail owner/repo --id 123 --member-limit 20 --body-chars 280 --json
```

This returns:

- the selected cluster summary
- each member thread
- a body snippet
- stored summary fields when present

### 7. Optional deeper inspection

Use search or neighbors as needed:

```bash
ghcrawl search owner/repo --query "download stalls" --mode hybrid --json
ghcrawl neighbors owner/repo --number 42 --limit 10 --json
```

## Output rules

- Report the repo name and whether you refreshed data in this run.
- When listing clusters, include:
  - cluster id
  - representative number and kind
  - display title
  - total size
  - PR count
  - issue count
  - latest updated time
- When naming a cluster in prose, use this shape:
  - `Cluster <clusterId> (#<representativeNumber> representative <issue|pr>)`
  - example: `Cluster 23945 (#42035 representative issue)`
- When drilling into a cluster, include clickable GitHub links for each issue/PR if you mention them.
- Prefer concise summaries over dumping raw JSON.
- If freshness is stale, say that explicitly:
  - embeddings outdated
  - clusters outdated
- If you stayed read-only because doctor was not healthy or the user did not explicitly request a refresh, say that explicitly.
